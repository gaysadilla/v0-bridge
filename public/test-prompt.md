# AUI Theme Test Prompt

Copy this exact prompt to test the AUI theme override in AI design tools:

## For v0.dev:

```
Use this ShadCN configuration for Asurion's design system:

{
  "style": "new-york",
  "tailwind": {
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "theme": {
    "cssVars": {
      "light": {
        "primary": "#8223d2",
        "primary-foreground": "#ffffff",
        "accent": "#4a68f9",
        "accent-foreground": "#ffffff",
        "secondary": "#edddf6",
        "secondary-foreground": "#211829",
        "background": "#ffffff",
        "foreground": "#1a1c1e",
        "muted": "#f1f0f4",
        "muted-foreground": "#5d5e61",
        "border": "#c6c6ca",
        "input": "#eeedf1",
        "destructive": "#b91a24",
        "radius": "0.25rem"
      }
    }
  }
}

Create a modern landing page with:
- Hero section with purple primary CTA button
- Feature cards using the theme colors
- Professional Asurion branding throughout
- Clean, corporate aesthetic

Apply the above theme configuration to ensure all components use Asurion's authentic purple (#8223d2) and blue (#4a68f9) colors.
```

## Alternative Short Version:

```
Apply Asurion design system theme:
- Primary: #8223d2 (purple)
- Accent: #4a68f9 (blue) 
- Use ShadCN components with these exact colors
- Professional corporate styling

Create a dashboard with purple buttons and blue accents following this color scheme exactly.
```

## Test Instructions:

1. Copy one of the prompts above
2. Paste into v0.dev, Loveable, or Figma Make
3. Verify the output uses:
   - Purple (#8223d2) for primary buttons/actions
   - Blue (#4a68f9) for accents
   - Clean, professional Asurion aesthetic
4. If colors are wrong, add: "Ensure all primary buttons are #8223d2 purple"
